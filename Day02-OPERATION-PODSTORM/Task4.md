# .NET Core Task: Explore & Troubleshoot Your Pod

## Task 4: Explore & Troubleshoot Your Pod (30 minutes)

### Objective
Inspect, debug, and interact with a running Kubernetes Pod. This task helps .NET Core developers understand how to troubleshoot issues when containerized .NET Core applications face failures or unexpected behaviors inside Pods.

### Steps

1. **Describe the Pod**
   - Get detailed information about the Pod:
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod demo-pod
     ```
   - Review:
     - Container status
     - Image pull messages
     - Restarts (if any)
     - Events (errors, pull issues, scheduling delays)

2. **Check Pod Logs**
   - View the logs generated by the container inside the Pod:
     ```bash
     kubectl logs demo-pod
     ```
   - This is especially useful for diagnosing startup issues in .NET Core apps (e.g., misconfigurations or missing dependencies).

3. **Enter the Pod Shell (if needed)**
   - Access the Podâ€™s container terminal:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec -it demo-pod -- /bin/bash
     ```
   - Once inside:
     - Explore directory structure
     - Verify running processes
     - Check configurations or environment variables (for .NET Core apps, check `appsettings.json`, environment variables, etc.)

4. **Make Observations**
   - Record the following:
     - **Container Running or CrashLoopBackOff?**  
     - **Restart Count?**  
     - **Any errors in logs?**  
     - **Events: Were there pull/image issues?**

### Why This Matters for .NET Core Developers
- When you deploy a .NET Core Web API or microservice, logs and Pod descriptions are key tools for identifying startup crashes or configuration failures.
- Restart counts help identify unhealthy services.
- Being able to exec into Pods is useful for advanced troubleshooting (e.g., checking environment variables or configurations).

### Estimated Time
ðŸ•’ **30 minutes**

### Cleanup (Optional)
If done testing and want to delete the Pod:
```bash
kubectl delete pod demo-pod
```

### Summary
In this task, you explored and troubleshot a running Pod using core Kubernetes commands such as describe, logs, and exec. These are essential skills for debugging .NET Core applications deployed in Kubernetes.
